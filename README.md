# Digital Ocean Auto-Build Test Page

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple HTML page that serves as a test for the Digital Ocean App Platform's auto-building and deployment capabilities. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how seamlessly Digital Ocean can build and deploy web applications directly from a repository.
